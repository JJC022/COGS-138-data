This project consists of deidentified MRI data from a large sample of acute ischemic stroke.

This dataset includes multiple structural modalities including T1 and FLAIR sequences. 

We also include DWI images that clearly show the location of lesions. Separate lesion map files are included for each participant with a visible lesion. These lesions were manually drawn and represent the gold-standard input for machine learning models of lesion segmentation in acute ischemic stroke.
